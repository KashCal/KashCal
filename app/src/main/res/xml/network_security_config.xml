    Network Security Configuration for KashCal.

    Security:
    - Cleartext (HTTP) traffic is disabled by default
    - Only HTTPS connections are allowed
    - This is required for CalDAV sync with iCloud and other providers

    Android 7.0+ (API 24+): This config is respected
    Earlier versions: Cleartext was allowed by default anyway
