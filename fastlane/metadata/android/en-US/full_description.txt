Your calendar. Your device. Your rules.

A modern, privacy-first calendar with iCloud and CalDAV sync — finally done right on Android. Works offline. Looks beautiful. Doesn't track you.

Features

• iCloud & CalDAV — Sync with Apple Calendar, Nextcloud, Radicale, Baikal, and more
• Offline-First — Works without internet. Sync when you want
• Material You — Beautiful design with dynamic theming
• Home Widgets — Agenda, week view, and date widgets
• ICS Subscriptions — Subscribe to public calendars (holidays, sports, etc.)
• Contact Birthdays — Auto-generate birthday calendar from contacts
• Search — Full-text search across all your events

Security & Privacy

Your Data Stays Yours:

• No Analytics — Zero tracking or telemetry
• No Accounts — No KashCal account required
• Local-First — Data stored on your device
• Open Source — Fully auditable codebase

Secure by Design:

• Fort Knox Mode — Other apps have no access to your events
• Encrypted Credentials — AES-256-GCM via Android Keystore
• HTTPS Only — Cleartext traffic blocked
• No WebViews — Native UI only
• Minimal Permissions — Only what's necessary

Why KashCal?

• Left iPhone but not iCloud? We sync with Apple Calendar natively
• Don't trust Big Tech with your schedule? We don't collect anything
• Self-host your life? We speak CalDAV fluently
• Privacy apps look terrible? We disagree
