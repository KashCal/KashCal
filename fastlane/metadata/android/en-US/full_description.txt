Your calendar. Your device. Your rules.

A privacy-first calendar that works offline and looks beautiful. Connect to iCloud — or don't. Your schedule, your choice.

FEATURES

• Privacy-First — Zero analytics, zero tracking. Your schedule stays private.
• Offline-First — Works without internet. Sync when you want, not when the app wants.
• iCloud Sync — Native CalDAV support for Apple Calendar on Android.
• Material You — Beautiful, modern design with dynamic theming.
• Home Widget — Today's agenda at a glance.
• Recurring Events — Full RFC 5545 RRULE support with exceptions.
• Progressive Sync — Events appear in 2-5 seconds, not 30.
• Search — Full-text search across all your events.
• Timezone Support — Per-event timezone with smart display.

SECURITY & PRIVACY

Your Data Stays Yours:
• No Analytics — Zero tracking, telemetry, or data collection
• No Accounts — No KashCal account required
• Local-First — Calendar data stored on your device
• Open Source — Fully auditable codebase

Secure by Design:
