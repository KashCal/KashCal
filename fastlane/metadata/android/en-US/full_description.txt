All your calendars. One app.

Your calendars are everywhere. Family stuff on iCloud. Holidays from some website. Birthdays buried in your contacts. Work on Nextcloud. KashCal brings them together on your Android.

Your schedule, together

• iCloud: Switched to Android but your family is still on Apple? Sync with iCloud calendars directly. No workaround needed.
• CalDAV: Nextcloud, Radicale, Baïkal, Stalwart, FastMail, and more. Native sync, no middleware.
• Holidays & schedules: Subscribe to any ICS calendar. Holidays, school schedules, sports seasons.
• Birthdays: Pulls from your contacts automatically.
• Local: Don't need sync? Works fully offline out of the box.

Material You with dynamic theming. Home screen widgets. Full-text search across all events. Per-event timezone for travel.

Private by default

No analytics. No telemetry. No KashCal account. Your data stays on your device unless you set up sync yourself.

• Encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM)
• Fort Knox Mode: other apps can't read your events
• HTTPS only, no WebViews, minimal permissions
• Open source: fully auditable
