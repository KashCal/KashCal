# KashCal

**Your calendar. Your device. Your rules.**

🔒 **Private** · 📴 **Offline** · 🔄 **Syncs** · 🔓 **Open Source**

## Welcome

KashCal is a privacy-first calendar for Android. It works completely offline with a local calendar, or syncs with CalDAV servers like iCloud, Nextcloud, Baïkal, and Radicale — your choice.

We believe your schedule is personal. That's why KashCal has zero analytics, zero tracking, and requires no account. Your calendar data stays on your device unless you explicitly choose to sync it.

## Who It's For

- **Privacy-conscious users** who want a calendar that respects their data
- **Android users** who want to sync with iCloud or other CalDAV servers
- **Anyone** who wants a beautiful, offline-first calendar without the bloat
