## Welcome

KashCal is a calendar for Android that works completely offline, with optional CalDAV sync for iCloud, Nextcloud, Baïkal, Radicale, and others. No analytics, no tracking, no KashCal account required.

## Who It's For

People who want a good calendar app that doesn't phone home. Whether you self-host with Nextcloud, still use iCloud after switching to Android, or just want something that works offline, KashCal does the job.
